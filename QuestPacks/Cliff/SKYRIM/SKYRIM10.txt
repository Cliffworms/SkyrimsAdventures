<ce>                    There's some trouble in %reg.
<ce>                    Farmers getting troubled by some bad types
<ce>                    who've hanging in the area. Got some time?
<--->
<ce>                    There's some trouble in %reg's countryside.
<ce>                    There's always some sort of trouble there, but now
<ce>                    it's come to a head. Care to help?
<--->
<ce>                    There's some trouble in %reg.
<ce>                    The %rt's too busy with a war, and we've been
<ce>                    hired to take care of their problems.
<ce>                    Are you interested?
<--->
<ce>                    We've been hired to deal with some pests in
<ce>                    %reg. Someone's got them riled up,
<ce>                    and you need to put an end to it. What do you
<ce>                    say?
<--->
<ce>                    %reg is seeing a lot of trouble from
<ce>                    some riff-raff. We need to head in and break them up.
<ce>                    Can I entrust you with this?
<--->
<ce>                    There's trouble up in %reg.
<ce>                    I'm a little surprised anyone's complaining
<ce>                    about it, but money is money. Got time?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Unfortunate, but someone else will take care of it.
<--->
<ce>                    Shame. But, I'm sure one of the whelps around here
<ce>                    will take it up.                  

AcceptQuest:  [1002]

Message: 1020
<ce>Ah, yes. ___dgn_ to the %di.
<ce>Nothing but a bunch of lowly bandits.
<ce>Cowards, who will take little effort.
<ce>Kill their leader, =foe1_ and
<ce>the rest should scatter like sand in
<ce>the wind. Do what must be done.

Message: 1021
<ce>Ah, yes. ___dgn2_ to the %di.
<ce>The restless dead. Not pretty, but if
<ce>you don't stop them, they'll move on
<ce>to the locals. Kill their necromancer,
<ce>=foe2_ and the undead will stand down.
<ce>Show them no mercy.

Message: 1022
<ce>Ah, yes. ___dgn_ to the %di.
<ce>It's a problem with the Orcs. Unpredictable,
<ce>unknowable, and dangerous. Kill their leader,
<ce>=foe3_, and the war party should scatter
<ce>away. Be careful.

Message: 1023
<ce>Ah, yes. ___dgn3_ to the %di.
<ce>It's a clan of giants led by a certain =foe4_.
<ce>The war is driving them out of their lands, and
<ce>they've started attacking settlements. 

Message: 1024
<ce>Ah, yes. ___dgn3_ to the %di.
<ce>You'll be clearing a nest of those harpies.
<ce>One in particular, nicknamed _foe5_ by
<ce>the locals, has been rather troublesome.
<ce>Show it and the rest of its feathery bastards
<ce>no mercy.

Message: 1025
<ce>Ah, yes. ___dgn3_ to the %di.
<ce>Oddly enough, it's spriggans. Or, rather,
<ce>one particular spriggan the farmers named
<ce>=foe6_. Usually they leave us alone,
<ce>but for some reason, this particular grove
<ce>isn't.

Message: 1026
<ce>Ah, yes. ___dgn4_ to the %di.
<ce>A place full of bloodsuckers led by one
<ce>called =foe7_. Take every precaution.
<ce>One bite, and you could end up as one
<ce>of them.

Message: 1027
<ce>Ah, yes. ___dgn5_ to the %di.
<ce>Rogue wizards. I've never trusted magic
<ce>types. The Mages Guild is bad enough.
<ce>Find and kill their leader, =foe8_.
<ce>The rest of the pointy hats should stand
<ce>down after that.

<ce>You hear someone say : 
<ce>
<ce>"Remember Orsinium!"

Message: 1033
<ce>You sense vibrations beneath your feet.
<ce>They appear as in rythm, like footsteps...
<--->
<ce>A loud scream pierces the silence :
<ce>
<ce>"Ayarg garag gar!"
<--->
<ce>A loud scream pierces the silence as
<ce>three tall figures run toward you...


Message: 1034
<ce>You notice a sapling that starts moving
<ce>towards you...
<--->
<ce>A bear and a rat, who were resting beside
<ce>a tree, suddenly stand up and stare at
<ce>you. The tree starts moving...

Message: 1035
<ce>A piercing screech breaks the silence.
<ce>What at first seem to be birds are
<ce>actually harpies flying towards you...
<--->
<ce>You see a shadow from a bird circling
<ce>around you. Then one more. You notice
<ce>those are not birds, but harpies
<ce>circling their prey...

Message: 1036
<ce>Ohh... but I will have your blood...
<--->
<ce>My thirst will be sated...
<--->
<ce>Oh, I can smell your blood...

<ce>You dare to interfere with me?
<--->
<ce>I knew I smelled mortal blood!
<--->
<ce>Now your blood is mine!
<--->
<ce>Pah, your blood is foul.
<--->
<ce>Soon... soon your blood will be mine...
<--->
<ce>Your blood calls me...
<--->
<ce>Why fight me? Your blood is already mine.
<--->
<ce>Your kind are finished.
<--->
<ce>Mortal fool, you can't stop us.
<--->
<ce>We own the night, fool.
<--->
<ce>The night belongs to us.
<--->
<ce>The sun cannot protect you any more!
<--->
<ce>Behold the power of Night!
<--->
<ce>Stop struggling. I'll give you a swift and beautiful death.
<--->
<ce>I'll drink you dry, mortal!
<--->
<ce>I love it when dinner walks right into my arms.
