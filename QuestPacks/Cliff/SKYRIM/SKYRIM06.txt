<ce>                    We have a bit of a sensitive matter this time.
<ce>                    A wealthy family has... misplaced one of their
<ce>                    heirlooms. And, yeah, it involves going
<ce>                    in a dungeon. Of course. So, what do you say?
<--->
<ce>                    Just in time. I was worried I'd have to do this
<ce>                    myself. Some rich folk had a trinket stolen and
<ce>                    they want us to get it back. By the way, it's
<ce>                    in a dungeon, if that can help you decide
<ce>                    wheter you want it or not.

<ce>                    Can't say I blame you. I'll find someone to
<ce>                    take care of it.
<--->
<ce>                    Not the response I was hoping for, but suit
<ce>                    yourself.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Good, good. These aren't the most glorious jobs,
<ce>                    but they pay well. I told the family we'd get
<ce>                    their _heirloom_ back in =timer_ days. Now, let me
<ce>                    check where it is exactly...
<--->
<ce>                    The nobleman set us a deadline of =timer_ days.
<ce>                    Move quickly so we can have this over and done
<ce>                    with. You'll be looking for a _heirloom_ in...
<ce>                    Ah, I'll check the name of the place again.
<--->
<ce>                    We're trusting you on this one. Bring honor to
<ce>                    the Fighters Guild. For a reason of their own,
<ce>                    our contractor told us they need the _heirloom_
<ce>                    in =timer_ days. Where did they say it may be
<ce>                    located again? Let me check...

<ce>                    Give it here. They've asked for the utmost discretion
<ce>                    on this matter, so I'll make sure it gets to them.
<ce>                    Here's your share of their reward.
<--->
<ce>                    Good, the heirloom looks undamaged. They'll be pleased,
<ce>                    I'm sure. And we're pleased with their money.
<--->
<ce>                    This is the heirloom, right? Nice work with this one.
<ce>                    You make us all proud.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Remember the family from whom you recovered their _heirloom_? They send their thanks to you.

QuestorPostFailure:   [1009]
If you can't follow simple instructions like recovering that family's heirloom in time, I don't know how you'll keep up in the Fighters Guild.

<ce>Right. It's in __dgn_, some marauder

<ce>Ah there it is. __dgn2_,
<ce>some natural cave or something I believe.
<ce>As for why whoever inhabits the place brought
<ce>the heirloom there, I have no idea.

Message: 1042
<ce>__dgn3_. An Orc stronghold. How could
<ce>I forget that? Those green-skins show no mercy.

Message: 1043
<ce>Right, it's __dgn4_. A place
<ce>inhabited by giants. They don't usually
<ce>cause problems like this, but these ones
<ce>are stirred up for some reason.

Message: 1044
<ce>__dgn5_. The rumors say the culprits are
<ce>vampires. I try not to listen to swaggle like that,
<ce>but figured you should know.

Message: 1045
<ce>__dgn6_. Of course, it's a group of
<ce>wizards they're pointing their fingers at. Who knows
<ce>what they want it for, but we want it back.
