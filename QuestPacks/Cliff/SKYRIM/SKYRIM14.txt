<ce>When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't
<ce>operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate
<ce>means to get them out of the way. We send you to plant
<ce>some phony evidence in the mark's house, and then tip
<ce>off the town guard... the rest takes care of itself.
<ce>Sound like you can handle it?
<--->
<ce>Someone wants to see somebody suffer. They're paying
<ce>a good bit of coin to have us plant the evidence in
<ce>their house to frame him. You in?
<--->
<ce>This one should be easy. Get in, plant the goods and
<ce>get out. Quiet and neat. Sound like your kind of job?
<--->
<ce>Somebody must have ticked-off our client badly. We
<ce>have to drop some drugs to frame the fellow. Our
<ce>client's impatient and keeps asking if the job's
<ce>done. Can you get him off my back?

<--->
<ce>Got a good one here. Personal score to settle between
<ce>myself and some fool. You up for it?
<--->
<ce>%mn2 finally got some dirt on the mark and the
<ce>evidence to back it up. Think you can give him
<ce>a hand by dropping some drugs in the mark's
<ce>house?

<ce>house?
<--->
<ce>Some fool angered someone pretty high up in the keep.
<ce>That noble wants to see him imprisoned and paid us to
<ce>do it. Can I count on you to frame that fool for me?
<--->
<ce>Got a personal score to settle and I'd consider it a
<ce>favor if you'd take the job. Think you can help me
<ce>out?
<--->
<ce>Sure, sure. Got one that should be pretty easy, as
<ce>long as you keep your weapon sheathed. Can you handle
<ce>it?
<--->
<ce>Yeah. Someone ticked off %ln and she wants to teach
<ce>them a lesson... our way. You in?
<--->
<ce>Yeah. Someone ticked off %ln and he wants to teach
<ce>them a lesson... our way. You in?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>All right, whatever you want.
<--->
<ce>No problem, I'll find someone else.
<ce>Don't worry about it.
<--->
<ce>Hey, you approached me. You want to play coward,
<ce>that's your problem.
<--->
<ce>Look, I don't like wasting my time.
<ce>Come back when you decide to get serious.
<--->
<ce>Not interested? Fine. Then let me offer it to someone
<ce>with a little more backbone.
<--->
<ce>You need to start pulling your own weight around here,
<ce>otherwise I might "forget" to offer you any more jobs.
<--->
<ce>Fine. I'll just keep all this coin for myself then.
<--->
<ce>Look, if you just want to sit around the hall all day
<ce>with yer thumb up yer arse, that's your business.
<ce>Just quit wasting my time.
<--->
<ce>The last time I checked, gold coins aren't falling
<ce>from the heavens. You better take some jobs if you
<ce>want to earn your share.
<--->
<ce>Keep turning down jobs like this and the Guild will
<ce>begin to lose respect for you.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>Good. Here's what you need to do. Take this
<ce>_evidence_ and plant it at _loc_ in
<ce>__loc_. We don't care who lives there,
<ce>that's not our concern. Our client expects
<ce>this to be done in =timer_ days, so get
<ce>moving.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>            

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>So, our client will be satisfied? 
<ce>Here's your gold. Try not to spend
<ce>it all in one place.
<--->
<ce>All done? Fine. I guess you'll need
<ce>your coin then.
<--->
<ce>The job's done? And with no strings
<ce>attached? Not bad. Here, got some
<ce>coin for you.

The Thieves Guild received a contract to
frame an enemy of one of our clients.
_questgiver_ of the Thieves Guild in
___questgiver_ told me to plant the
_evidence_ at _loc_
in __loc_. I need to complete
this job without getting caught. The
client expects the deed to be done in
=timer_ days. 

Message: 1020
<ce>This is _loc_. Dropping the
<ce>_evidence_ somewhere around
<ce>will be enough to frame the owner.

Message: 1030
<ce>As you remove the _evidence_ from your pack
<ce>and deposit it somewhere, the owner suddenly
<ce>arrives, catching you red-handed.
<ce>
<ce>"%oth! Who are.. what are... GUARDS! GUARDS!"
<ce>he screams as he runs outside.

<ce>
<ce>"%oth! Who are.. what are... GUARDS! GUARDS!"
<ce>she screams as she runs outside.

Message: 1040
<ce>You take the _evidence_ from your pack and
<ce>carefully place it where the guards will easily
<ce>find it. The deed is done.

Message: 1050
<ce>You idiot! We have to cover your mess up and
<ce>that costs us gold... which means you don't
<ce>get any.
<--->
<ce>Being connected to a criminal didn't make the
<ce>client happy... next time, act like a real
<ce>thief and don't get caught.
<--->
<ce>Good going... you got caught in doing the deed.
<ce>Now how do you think that looks for the Guild?
<ce>Better luck next time.

Message: 1060
<ce>It has been =timer_ days since you were sent to
<ce>__loc_ to plant the _evidence_ at
<ce>_loc_. The client will not be happy to
<ce>learn that the deed has never been done.
