<ce>            It sounds like %reg is too busy with their
<ce>            war to keep their own prisoners in line.
<ce>            One of them's escaped, and you're going to find
<ce>            that coward. If you want the job, that is.
<--->
<ce>            The braggarts in %reg always claim that no
<ce>            prisoner escapes their mines. What you don't hear
<ce>            about are the ones who break off from escorts on
<ce>            the way to %cn. One of them's escaped,
<ce>            and you're going to find that coward. That is,
<ce>            if you're interested.
<--->
<ce>            %reg seems to have trouble keeping their
<ce>            prisoners in line. One of them's escaped, and
<ce>            you're going to find that coward. If you want the
<ce>            job, that is.
<--->
<ce>            The idiots in %reg still think the best place
<ce>            for prisoners is a hole in the ground. No surprise,
<ce>            but one of them's gotten out. Again. One of them's
<ce>            escaped, and you're going to find that coward.
<ce>            That is, if you're interested.
<--->
<ce>            The so-called prison in %reg leaks like one of
<ce>            their fishnets. This is what happens when you
<ce>            let thieves run some of your towns. The prisoners
<ce>            just walk right out. One of them's escaped, and
<ce>            you're going to find that coward. If you want the
<ce>            job, that is.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            We choose our battles, and you've chosen yours.
<ce>            Someone else can take care of it.
<--->
<ce>            Unfortunate, but someone else will take care of it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            The prisoner's called _dummy_. At this point
<ce>            they don't care what happens to %g2 and neither do I.
<ce>            Best to just kill %g2 and be done with it. I've been
<ce>            told %g ran towards in the direction of ___loc1_. 
<ce>            Start your search there, ask around and follow the trail.
<ce>            I promised the criminal would be dealt with before
<ce>            =timer_ days have passed. Be careful, %g is known to
<ce>            be dangerous.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>            

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            So, _dummy_'s dead? You've brought good
<ce>            reputation to the Fighters Guild. More importantly,
<ce>            some gold.
<--->
<ce>            Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you
<ce>            have my thanks.

%qdt
_questgiver_ of the Fighters Guild in
___questgiver_ has ordered me to catch
_dummy_, an escaped prisoner. I need
to start my search in ___loc1_, where
%g was last seen. I have =timer_ days, else
%g may escape %reg.
