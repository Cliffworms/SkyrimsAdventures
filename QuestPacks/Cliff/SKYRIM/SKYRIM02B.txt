<ce>                    Greetings, %ra. You look like
<ce>                    you can handle yourself in combat.
<ce>                    The %rt has put out a bounty
<ce>                    on a dragonling that's been terrorizing
<ce>                    the countryside. Here, take a look at
<ce>                    this decree for details.
<--->
<ce>                    Yes? Oh, aren't you %pcn? I think
<ce>                    I heard of you. Say, would you like
<ce>                    to be of service to %rn,
<ce>                    %rt of %reg? A dragonling
<ce>                    has been causing trouble to the
<ce>                    farmers. %rt has published a decree.
<ce>                    Here, take a look.

<ce>                    I see. This is unfortunate. I believe
<ce>                    a hunter of some kind will answer the call.
<--->
<ce>                    No? Maybe the stories I heard about you
<ce>                    were tall tales then.

<ce>                    The dragonling is dead? Excellent. You've
<ce>                    done us a great service. Here is your reward. 
<--->
<ce>                    The good people have you to thank. Killing
<ce>                    a dragonling is no small feat. Good work,
<ce>                    %ra. Here's your gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
Did you hear? The %ln Orchard has been burned to cinders! The work of a dragongling they say!
<--->
A traveler told me he saw a dragonling flying away and carrying a sheep.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Many of us cannot believe it. A %ra hunted down the dragonling, the terror of %reg! I'm sure it's still around. Can't trust anything the %rt says.
<--->
Someone at the tavern told me the dragonling that terrorized %reg's countryside has been killed by a brave %ra. Impressive!

Ah, %reg's dragonling hunter. How can I help?
