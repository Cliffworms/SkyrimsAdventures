QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>            Most of the establishments in %reg keep
<ce>            their transactions recorded within business ledgers.
<ce>            Your job would be to change the numbers in those
<ce>            books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look
<ce>            legit. Feel like doing a bit of writin'?
<--->
<ce>            _loc_ is a regular target for the Guild.
<ce>            They keep pretty shoddy records, so the job should be
<ce>            a cinch. You in?
<--->
<ce>            We want to waylay a shipment on the way from
<ce>            _loc_ without them even noticin' anything
<ce>            went missin'. Want the job?
<--->
<ce>            Yeah, sure. Got a business on tap that could use a
<ce>            little number rearrangin'. What do you say?
<--->
<ce>            Okay, got just the one for you. Ledger's just beggin'
<ce>            to be changed and the Guild could use the coin. How
<ce>            about it?
<--->
<ce>            Have a client lookin' to have a rival's business ledger
<ce>            changed. Don't know the reason, and don't want to know.
<ce>            Count you in?
<--->
<ce>            Got a personal request from the Crow on this numbers job.
<ce>            He says we may hit 'em hard later, and wants to prep
<ce>            their books. Help us out?
<--->
<ce>            These marks keep their ledger all neat and tidy, but
<ce>            they're ripe for some change if you know what I mean.
<ce>            Take it?
<--->
<ce>            All right. Got a simple one. Just get in, change the books
<ce>            and be back in time for last call. So how's about it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Don't even give it a second thought. Maybe next time.
<--->
<ce>            Sure, no problem. We'll find someone else to do it.
<--->
<ce>            Your not winnin' points with me with that attitude.
<--->
<ce>            When you find your nerves, then we'll talk.
<--->
<ce>            Fine, but you're not gettin' any wealthier by weaslin'
<ce>            out of everythin' I offer you.
<--->
<ce>            You're not going to get richer with that attitude.
<--->
<ce>            You need to bloody well get your priorities straight
<ce>            if you want to make it around here.
<--->
<ce>            Too bad, looks like I need to find someone else to
<ce>            take care of business.
<--->
<ce>            If you think you'll make your fortune kickin' around
<ce>            the guild all day, that's where your wrong.
<--->
<ce>            And here I thought you were a master criminal.
<ce>            Guess I was wrong.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Great. Visit _loc_ in __loc_ and find
<ce>            the ledger. Change the numbers and get back
<ce>            here. Like I said, no killin' and don't get
<ce>            caught. I'm giving ya =timer_ days for this job.
<ce>            Watch yourself out there, %lev.
<--->
<ce>            Finally, someone with backbone. Visit
<ce>            _loc_ in __loc_ and find the

<ce>            Now that's what I like to hear. Visit

<ce>            Like I said, no killin' and don't get caught.
<ce>            I'm giving ya =timer_ days for this job.
<ce>            Off you go.
<--->
<ce>            Keep this up and you'll be rich enough to retire
<ce>            before you know it. Visit _loc_ in
<ce>            __loc_ and find the ledger. Change the
<ce>            numbers and get back here. Like I said, no killin'
<ce>            and don't get caught. I'm giving ya =timer_ days for
<ce>            this job. Good luck.
<--->
<ce>            Visit _loc_ in __loc_ and find
<ce>            the ledger. Change the numbers and get back
<ce>            here. You get caught, and we've never heard
<ce>            of you. I'm giving ya =timer_ days for this job.
<ce>            Watch yourself out there, %lev.

<ce>            I hardly noticed you were gone. Got your share of the
<ce>            spoils right here, %lev.
<--->
<ce>            Got all your gold ready, %lev. You can count every
<ce>            coin, it's all there.
<--->
<ce>            A pleasure as always, boss. Here's your payment.
<--->

<ce>            Here's your coin.
<--->
<ce>            If you don't watch it, I may actually start to
<ce>            respect you. Job well done.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
We made a good bunch of gold thanks to your work at _loc_. Anything ye need?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I didn't sleep well last night, thanks to your botched job. You know, the one about _loc_'s ledger.

Message: 1010
%qdt
I've been told by _questgiver_ of
the Thieves Guild in __questgiver_ 
to forge false entries in the ledger at
_loc_ in __loc_.
I need to complete this job without killing
any of the location's residents or getting
caught. 

Message: 1020
<ce>The ledger should be somewhere around
<ce>_loc_. Changing the numbers
<ce>while the owner is around may be more
<ce>difficult...

Message: 1030
<ce>You have changed the numbers without
<ce>attracting attention.

Message: 1040
<ce>The shop's owner suddenly turns the corner,
<ce>seeing you meddling with the ledger.
<ce>
<ce>"Guards! GUARDS!" he screams to a nearby
<ce>patrol of city guards.

Message: 1050
<ce>Gettin' pinched doesn't cut it with our clients.
<ce>If you want to get paid next time, stay clean.
<--->
<ce>I had to use your pay to smooth things over with
<ce>the client. They didn't want to be associated
<ce>with a criminal. Next time, don't get caught.
<--->
<ce>You needed to do this clean and quiet, and you
<ce>failed. Now we need to use your payment to cover
<ce>your mistake.

Message: 1060
<ce>It has been more than =timer_ days since you
<ce>were tasked with changing the numbers in
<ce>_loc_'s ledger.
