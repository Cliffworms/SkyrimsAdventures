<ce>                    Greetings, %ra. You look like
<ce>                    you can handle yourself in combat.
<ce>                    The %rt has put out a bounty
<ce>                    on a giant that's been terrorizing
<ce>                    the countryside. Here, take a look at
<ce>                    this decree for details.
<--->
<ce>                    Yes? Oh, aren't you %pcn? I think
<ce>                    I heard of you. Say, would you like
<ce>                    to be of service to %rn,
<ce>                    %rt of %reg? A giant
<ce>                    has been causing trouble in the
<ce>                    area. %rt has published a decree.
<ce>                    Here, take a look.

<ce>                    I see. This is unfortunate. I believe
<ce>                    a hunter of some kind will answer the call.
<--->
<ce>                    No? Maybe the stories I heard about you
<ce>                    were tall tales then.

<ce>                    The giant =giant_ is dead? Excellent. You've
<ce>                    done us a great service. Here is your reward. 
<--->
<ce>                    The good people have you to thank. Killing
<ce>                    a giant is no small feat. Good work, %ra.
<ce>                    Here's your gold.
