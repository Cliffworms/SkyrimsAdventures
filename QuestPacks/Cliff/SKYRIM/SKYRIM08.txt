<ce>                    %lev, we've received a desperate missive.
<ce>                    A citizen here in %cn has been
<ce>                    kidnapped. The Fighters Guild has been
<ce>                    asked for assistance, and we shall answer.
<ce>                    Particularly when the pay is as good as
<ce>                    this. Do you want this contract?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Then gold and glory shall not be yours.
<ce>                    Hey! %nam? Does that interest you?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Right. We have been given =timer_ days
<ce>                    to rescue _dummy_ who's been
<ce>                    taken to... where again?
<ce>
<ce>                    Hey, %nam! Can you read me
<ce>                    that part of the missive again?

<ce>                    This is _dummy_, I believe?
<ce>                    This is good to hear. You've brought honor
<ce>                    to the Fighters Guild and yourself.
<ce>                    _dummy_, stay here. I will send
<ce>                    for your relatives.
<ce>
<ce>                    "I'm ever so grateful, %pcn." says
<ce>                    _dummy_, smiling.
