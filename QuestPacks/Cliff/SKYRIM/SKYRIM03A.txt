<ce>                    Hello. Say, I look at you and... yeah.
<ce>                    You may be interested in this bounty
<ce>                    the %rt's men left here. There's
<ce>                    an Orc leader of some kind causing all
<ce>                    kinds of trouble. Do you want to see it?
<--->
<ce>                    Ah, what's new under the sun right? 
<ce>                    A courier dropped a bounty letter issued
<ce>                    by the %rt to kill an Orc leader of
<ce>                    some kind. Some things never change with
<ce>                    these degenerates. Wanna take a look?

<ce>                    I guess someone else will take care of it. What
<ce>                    can I do for you?
<--->
<ce>                    Can't blame you. That sounds way too dangerous.
<ce>                    Why can't the %rt take care of it anyway?
<--->
<ce>                    'tis a shame. Those green- skins will continue to
<ce>                    prey upon the poor fols of %reg.
